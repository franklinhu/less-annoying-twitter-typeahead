# less-annoying-twitter-typeahead

A Chrome extension that reorders the typeahead topics so they don't
show up where you least expect them

## What this fixes

1. Type a handle into the search bar
1. See the account you want and intend on clicking
1. Typeahead topics populate at the top of the results
1. You click the topic and not the account
