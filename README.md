# less-annoying-twitter-typeahead

A Chrome extension that reorders the typeahead results so you don't
click the wrong link:

## What this fixes

1. Type a handle into the search bar
1. See the account you want and intend on clicking
1. Typeahead topics populate at the top of the results
1. You click the topic and not the account
